Ministry of Education (MOE) Deputy Minister Yeh Ping-cheng (葉丙成) announced on Tuesday (Aug. 6) the government’s plans to launch an artificial intelligence (AI) university alliance.

The ministry opened the two-day International Digital Learning Forum 2024 in Taipei on Tuesday, per CNA. The event attracted over 300 scholars and industry representatives from various countries on the first day.

In his speech, Yeh said the plan will offer three cross-university credit programs and 14 courses, allowing students to learn from the best teachers. The initiative will also include diverse AI elective courses to give students equal learning opportunities, he added.

For elementary and secondary schools, Yeh said the ministry plans to organize large-scale student AI competitions. These competitions will use gamification to teach students how to build AI models that control game characters, competing to see whose model performs best, he explained.

The ministry said Taiwan’s comprehensive digital learning strategy for primary and secondary schools is ahead of many countries, demonstrating Taiwan’s innovative power in educational technology.

The forum will run from Aug. 6-7 at the Grand Mayfull Hotel Taipei. More information can be found here.
