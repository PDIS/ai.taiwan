Taipei, May 14 (CNA) Fifteen startups in Taiwan will participate in Startup Thailand 2018, the biggest tech conference in Southeast Asia, later this week to explore business opportunities in Thailand, the Executive Center for the Asian Silicon Valley Plan announced Monday.

The center said it will join with the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration in bringing 15 startups in the smart agriculture, artificial intelligence (AI), information security and e-commerce areas to the show to help them strengthen their global networks.

Among the 15 Taiwanese startups, Bethesda Scientific Corp., a biotechnology company specializing in sustainable agriculture, and Umbo CV, an AI firm developing autonomous security systems for companies, will take part in an international startup competition as part of the show, being held on Bangkok from May 17-20.

Taiwanese startups participating in the event hope to increase their international presence and explore cooperative ventures and investments in the Thai market, said Cheng Hsu-feng (鄭旭峰), the executive secretary of the executive center.

Given Taiwan's technical capabilities in precision agriculture and other sectors, the event is expected to provide plenty of opportunities for domestic startups to develop their areas of specialization in the Thai market, Cheng said.
