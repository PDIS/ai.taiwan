The 2023 Taiwan AI Academy Annual Conference held its opening ceremony on Friday, featuring a keynote speech from Taiwan Vice President Lai Ching-te (賴清德). In his speech, Lai called for the development of AI to be accessible to all people, regardless of location or economic status.

Lai says that AI is becoming further integrated into our daily lives. He also expressed his amazement about the capabilities of AI programs such as AlphaGo and ChatGPT. Lai adds more and more countries are trying to develop their own chatbots and that Taiwan should not be left behind. 

Lai stressed the importance of having an AI chatbot tailored to Taiwan's specific needs, particularly in critical fields like healthcare and law. He says this will safeguard Taiwan’s critical information and avoid reliance on foreign technologies. Lai also noted that AI requires a lot of computing power, chips, and other ICT infrastructure, which could be a great opportunity for Taiwan’s companies.
