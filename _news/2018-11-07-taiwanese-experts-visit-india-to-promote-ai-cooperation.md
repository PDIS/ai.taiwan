Taiwan and India will move to deepen their cooperation in the research of technologies related to artificial intelligence (AI), including the Internet of Things (IoT), Taiwan's representative office in India said Monday.

The initiative will proceed under cooperation programs promoted by technology ministries of the two countries, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center said in a statement.

A Taiwanese delegation of scholars attended a conference on AI held Nov. 1-2 at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) under a bilateral cooperation plan framework between the ministries of science and technology of Taiwan and India.

The six-member delegation was led by Yeh Chia-hung (葉家宏), vice dean of the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan Normal University and composed of researchers from various universities.

Seventeen papers by 17 Taiwanese and Indian researchers were presented at the conference, which was attended by more than 100 teachers and students.

At the conference, Sivaji Chadaram, director of the International Cooperation Division under India's Ministry of Science and Technology, gave a presentation on India's science and technology policy, its current research and development and its future prospects in the field.

Chen Ho-hsien (陳和賢), head of the technology division of Taiwan's representative office in India, addressed the current state and progress of cooperation on science and technology between Taiwan and India and Taiwan's AI policy and flagship plans, while giving a briefing on the opportunities for those seeking to pursue postdoctoral research in Taiwan.

The AI conference focused on addressing possible AI issues and for technologists involved in AI, including data analysis, IoT, in-depth learning, medical diagnosis apps, algorithms, blockchains, wireless sensor networks, and the integration of hardware and software design, Chen said.

Experts from the two countries also discussed future cooperation in the AI field, he added.

In addition to the AI forum, Chen said that under the Taiwan-India bilateral science and technology cooperation framework, the two countries will hold a smart city seminar in Taipei next year to promote academic, industrial and professional exchanges.

During its three-day stay in Chennai, the delegation also visited an AI laboratory at IIT Madras and the Chennai office of Pathfinder Global FZCO, an international enterprise specializing in AI and big data, according to the representative office.
