The first Taiwan International AIoT Show kicks off Tuesday and will run through Friday at Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center, showcasing a wide range of smart tech products and solutions such as cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT).

Other areas to feature include artificial intelligence (AI), drones, smart passports, robotic process automation and low-power wide-area (LPWA) networks.

Exhibitors with booths at the trade show will include the National Center for High-Performance Computing, SYSCOM Computer Engineering Co., Chunghwa Telecom, Far EasTone Telecommunications (FET), SUSE Linux Enterprise, Asia Pacific Telecom Co. and the Industrial Technology Research Institute, according to event organizers.

Chunghwa Telecom will showcase smart passports and the robots it has developed to explore AIoT business opportunities, according to the company.

In addition, FET said Monday it will unveil its applications of IoT-enabled asset tracking technology at the first AIoT Taiwan, such as global positioning system (GPS) telematics, which combines telecommunications and informatics.

GPS telematics also involves sending, receiving and storing information on remote objects, most commonly motor vehicles, but also trains, cargo ships, agricultural machinery and marine vessels, FET added.

Asia Pacific Telecom has said it will showcase the company's IoT platform for smart disaster management at the event.

Meanwhile, Asia Pacific Telecom said a 300-unit limited edition of the "Kebbi" robot it previously launched as a companion for children sold out through pre-orders in just three days and it now plans to roll out another 200 units.
