An AI robotics alliance was established in Taiwan on Tuesday that hopes to capitalize on the current AI boom and generate more than NT$1 trillion (US$34.01 billion) in production value by 2030.

The alliance was organized by six major business groups in Taiwan, including the Taiwan Automation Intelligence and Robotics Association (TAIROA).

With the group setting its sights on creating more than NT$1 trillion in output value by 2030, the TAIROA said it would create five Taiwan-made robotics models under four platforms -- automated mobile vehicles, foot-shaped robotics, humanoid robots and specialty design.

The association said Taiwan specializes in the development of tech gadgets used in robotics production such as controllers, sensors, chips, and electric machinery, while also providing integrated system solutions and developing AI computing capabilities and smart software.

The association said these strengths should help Taiwan set up an AI robotics ecosystem and develop AI robotics technologies up to international standards to help made-in-Taiwan (MIT) products become competitive in the global market.

Part of the effort will involve setting up a comprehensive supply chain in Taiwan, focused specifically on the development of decision support systems, power systems and control systems, the TAIROA said in a statement.

The alliance will introduce its products to eight major markets -- health care, logistics, agriculture, manufacturing, caregiving, restaurants, disaster relieving and patrolling -- the TAIROA said.

Speaking at the group's inauguration ceremony, Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim (蕭美琴) said the alliance's establishment demonstrated cooperation and unity among industries in Taiwan and concrete action on innovation to pursue forward-looking technologies.

Hsiao said she expected AI robotics to serve as a foundation of the next industrial revolution, and said Taiwan has positioned itself well to compete in the global smart robotics market.

The other groups in the alliance are the Taiwan Machine Tool & Accessory Builders' Association (TMBA), the Taiwan Association of Machinery Industry (TAMI), the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association (TEEMA), the Taipei Computer Association (TCA), and the Cloud Computing and IoT Association in Taiwan (CIAT).
