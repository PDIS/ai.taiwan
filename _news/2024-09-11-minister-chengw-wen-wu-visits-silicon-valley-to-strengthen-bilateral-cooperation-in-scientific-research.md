After visiting the Czech Republic, Germany and other regions of the US, Minister Cheng-Wen Wu arrived in Silicon Valley on September 9, Pacific Standard Time, to attend the annual conference of the Taiwan Science and Technology Hub (Taiwan S&T Hub) and engage with technology industry professionals and prominent researchers. Over the course of just two days, Minister Wu conducted a series of intensive visits aimed at strengthening Taiwan-U.S. scientific cooperation while promoting NSTC policies that support Taiwan’s efforts to become an “AI Island,” further enhancing Taiwan’s technological image. 

The Taiwan S&T Hub, which was established at Stanford University last year, held its 2nd International Conference on September 10. This year, the conference focused on Taiwan's advantages in high tech, semiconductors, and AI, as well as cross-discipline issues such as biomedicine and energy. Speakers included Stanford University Doerr School of Sustainability Dean Arun Majumdar, Stanford University School of Medicine Dean Lloyd B. Minor, Stanford University School of Medicine Professor Sylvia K. Plevritis, UC Berkley Professor Emeritus Chenming Hu, UC Berkeley EECS Professor Sayeef Salahuddin, and US CHIPS Research and Development Program Director Dr. Eric K. Lin. Specialists from Taiwan included Academia Sinica Academician Chen Chien-Jen, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Professor Bing-Joe Hwang and National Taiwan University Associate Professor John Chung-En Liu.

In his opening remarks, Minister Wu pointed out that Stanford University not only excels in academics and has a global influence through its Silicon Valley entrepreneurial spirit, but also achieves notable success in sports, having cultivated many Olympic Gold medalist. Sports and technology are the common grounds for Taiwan and the U.S., and promoting sports technology is currently a key policy for Taiwan. The Taiwan S&T Hub established at Stanford will not only integrate resources and collaborate with world-class talent to cultivate top R&D professionals, but also assist Taiwan in developing its own application service systems. Furthermore, the Hub aims to bring Silicon Valley’s innovative thinking back to Taiwan, spreading it across various innovative applications to improve human life, benefiting both Taiwan and the world. 

Minister Wu visited NVIDIA and AMD. He also had in-depth conversations with senior managers of Vanguard International Semiconductor Corporation, Synopsys, Super Micro Computer, etc., focusing on the overview of Taiwan’s technological development and the prospects for technology cooperation in key areas such as artificial intelligence, integrated circuit design, and advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes. 

At the September 10 press conference and banquet, Minister Wu described Taiwan’s plans to become an “AI Island” to the media and the technology community from Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. Minister Wu also stated that Taiwan is committed to applying AI wherever possible, and that the NSTC will coordinate the resources of relevant government agencies to create a complete AI chain from design to manufacturing.

During this visit, Minister Wu engaged in policy sharing and feedback exchange with local technology elites. This not only strengthened the cooperation between Taiwan and the U.S in forward-looking technology fields and deepened Taiwan-U.S. partnership but also enhanced international recognition of Taiwan's technological capabilities. Additionally, it helped the international community understand that Taiwan has begun applying semiconductor and AI technologies across various industries, with the goal of attracting startups to establish themselves in Taiwan.
