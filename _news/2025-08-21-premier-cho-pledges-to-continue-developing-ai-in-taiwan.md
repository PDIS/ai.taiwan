Premier Cho Jung-tai said Aug. 20 at the joint opening of Taiwan Automation Intelligence Robot Show and Automation Taipei that the government is promoting artificial intelligence to spur Taiwan’s economy.
 
After years of AI upgrades and digital transformation, Taiwan’s traditional industry sector is making strides with fresh vitality, Cho said. At the same time, the country continues to thrive in its key role in smart manufacturing, he added.
 
The premier cited America’s AI Action Plan, unveiled by U.S. President Donald Trump in July, and the Ten Major AI Infrastructure Projects initiative proposed earlier this year by Taiwan’s National Development Council. He said the 2026 budget proposal will include specific policy measures to keep Taiwan at the forefront of global high-tech development.
 
Cho added that the initiative comprises AI infrastructure, smart applications and the core technologies of silicon photonics, quantum computing and robotics. The government will also strive to develop sovereign AI systems, enhance computing power, promote talent cultivation and invest NT$100 billion (US$3.3 billion) on related projects to create a smart environment for all people in Taiwan.
 
In response to the impact of new U.S. tariffs, the premier said the Cabinet has proposed amendments to a social and economic resilience enhancement budget that raise the available funding to NT$590 billion. He called on all segments of society to support the bill and ensure Taiwan’s national competitiveness.
