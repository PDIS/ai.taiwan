AsusTek Computer Inc., Taiwan Mobile, Co., Ltd., and Quanta Computer, Inc. jointly announced that they will collaborate on the construction of a national AI host project in Taiwan to assist in the construction of a next-generation AI computing host. They will also establish an AI cloud big data computing platform, and the total cost of the two projects will total nearly NT$1.1 billion. The projects are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year.

In this collaboration, Asus will be responsible for the cloud server, cloud service platform, and AI application integration services; meanwhile, Taiwan Mobile will be responsible for the construction of computer rooms and information services, and Quanta will be responsible for the AI/HPC computing and data storage platform.

The establishment of this project marks the first time that these three Taiwanese companies have formed an alliance, and it is a vertical integration with the middle and lower reaches of the industry from terminal equipment manufacturing and the establishment of networks to technological application services planning. It is also a cross-industry collaboration between companies in the domain of software and hardware manufacturing, telecommunications, and finance.

Quanta stated that the establishment of the “Taiwanese AI A Team” is in response to the national AI development strategy and will bring together top-notch Taiwanese server, cloud, networking, and AI technologies to take the lead in the development and promotion of the domestic AI industry and provide world-class international AI cloud solutions.
