A team of Taiwan researchers and an IC design house have jointly unveiled a deep-learning image-recognition AI chip whose production cost could be as low as only US$1.

The Mipy chip, conceived by three electrical engineering professors from the National Taiwan Normal University and designed by AVSdsp, enable large-quantity applications for home, car, advertising, education, secutiry, police, industrial and toy products.

The university said Mipy is the smallest in size and lowest in cost so far available on the AI market.

The developers said Mipy is a cooperative IC placed next to the main controller chip, and can be easily built into any PCB that has a primary audio-video processing function.
