To prepare for the arrival of AI Era, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Science and Technology joined Executive Yuan in its implementation of “the Taiwan AI Action Plan”. Through the concept of “replacing training with practical experience”, AI talent training mechanism “Answering Industry-related Questions with Manpower Talent” was established. On May 24, Premier Lai Ching-te, hosted the International AI Talent Cultivation Summit. Representatives from Google, Microsoft Taiwan, NVIDIA, Tze Chiang Foundation of Science and Technology, Wiedu, Taiwan AI Academy, Institute for Information Industry, and other Taiwanese/international AI training resources converged at the Summit, along with a number of newly established teams and over 150 senior executives from various associations and enterprises, to witness the accelerated promotion of the 5 2 Industrial Innovation and Development centering on AI as the core.

In order to confront the imminent wave of artificial intelligence, the Executive Yuan has already proposed the “Taiwan AI Action Plan” this year (2018) to fully develop and secure Taiwan’s place in smart system production. In addition, to speed up the progress of integrating AIinto Taiwan’s industries, the five key focuses, which are cultivating AI talent at a rapid pace, promoting preliminary AI projects, building international AI innovation hubs, opening up venues and regulations, and incorporating AI into industries, will also be emphasized.

In his speech, Premier Lai emphasized that by strengthening Taiwan’s existing advantages, where the hardware manufacturing industry continues to provide the driving force to increase economic growth, and by taking advantage of the spark generated through software innovation and entrepreneurship as well as connecting with the rich resources provided by international partners, Taiwan can be transformed into a major AI innovation hub and one of the largest smart technology providers in the world.

By using smart factory equipment as case studies, Minister Shen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs explained that incorporating AI into our industries is already an inevitable trend. The government will accelerate its efforts in assisting industries with training core talent and help newly established teams to capitalize on the opportunity to participate as AI solution providers.
