At the Cabinet's weekly meeting Thursday, Premier Cho Jung-tai received a briefing from the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) on a program to achieve excellence in food safety management. Focusing on three main areas—food source risk management, chain of custody certification and community monitoring—the program will invest NT$1.85 billion (US$57.7 million) over four years to promote the integration of food safety mechanisms, strengthen their management, inspection and guidance processes, and expand the introduction of AI technologies.

The promotion of food safety forms part of the Executive Yuan's core policy agenda to crack down on five types of crime—organized crime, financial crime, gun crime, drug crime and fraud crime—and uphold seven types of safety—public safety, food safety, road safety, occupational safety, school safety, housing safety and cyber safety.

Premier Cho explained that a key feature of the program is the use of innovative digital technologies to bolster food safety management. He instructed the MOHW to facilitate the adoption of AI technologies to optimize risk management and early warning mechanisms for food safety incidents, monitor international alerts, ensure safe sourcing of imported food products, improve customer service systems and regulate food advertisements. These efforts will further strengthen the national food safety network. <br/>
