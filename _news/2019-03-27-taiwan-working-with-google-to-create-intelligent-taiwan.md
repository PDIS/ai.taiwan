Vice Premier Chen Chi-mai attended Google’s Intelligent Taiwan 2019 event on Wednesday, where he thanked the internet giant for helping Taiwan lay a strong foundation for technological innovation.

Taiwan has become Google’s largest research and development base in the Asia-Pacific. Since the launch of the Intelligent Taiwan project in 2018, the company has expanded investment in its Taiwan data center, completed a deal to purchase renewable electricity, trained artificial intelligence (AI) talent, and increased research and development investment across Taiwan. Vice Premier Chen said he is pleased to see Google announce more expansions and commitments in the nation, as it reflects the confidence held by multinational corporations in Taiwan’s digital environment.

The Intelligent Taiwan project will soon launch comprehensive initiatives with a three-pronged focus on people, the economy and the ecosystem. In terms of people, Google plans to train 10,000 local individuals for AI technology and another 100,000 for digital marketing by 2020. The project is also expected to accelerate the pace of cooperation among industry, academia and the government, the vice premier added.
