At Thursday’s weekly meeting of the Cabinet, Premier Lai Ching-te received a briefing by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) on the execution and planning of the AI Edge semiconductor “moonshot” project to accelerate the development of artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor processes as well as the research and development of systems on a chip.

AI Edge is an effort by MOST to actively advance core AI technologies within Taiwan’s semiconductor manufacturing industry. The project draws on broader endeavors under the “five plus two” innovative industries plan to construct a semiconductor ecosystem for work on AIoT, or AI over the internet of things. Premier Lai applauded the ministry’s push to strengthen critical technologies central to the semiconductor industry and enhance the competitiveness of supply chains in Taiwan.

The project brings together academic and research institutions to work in cooperation with 62 businesses and manufacturers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and MediaTek Inc., on such forward-looking technologies as a 3-nanometer chip process. The premier noted that the project’s model of industry guiding academia and academia supporting industry not only promotes industrial and technological innovation, but also encourages industry to increase investment and put down roots in Taiwan.

MOST said that Taiwan’s leading advantages in the semiconductor industry will serve as starting points for AI Edge. Six core technologies, in particular, will be used to create an uncontested market space for AI-related technology: innovative sensing devices, circuits and systems; next generation memory design; cognitive computing and AI chips; IoT systems and security for the intelligent edge; system solutions for unmanned vehicles and augmented and virtual reality applications; and emerging semiconductor processes, materials and device technologies.

MOST indicated that the future incorporation into everyday life of AI, fifth-generation wireless applications, and IoT devices will drive a new wave of semiconductor demand. Working hand in hand with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, MOST pledged to push the limits in pursuing its 2022 objectives for critical AI technologies, including fostering top semiconductor process and chip design talent, and vigorously developing advantageous technologies and newly emerging industries.
