At Thursday's weekly Cabinet meeting, Premier Cho Jung-tai was briefed by the National Science and Technology Council on its progress and planning pertaining to the development of next-generation, high-performance computing systems. The premier said that achieving this goal will help promote the research and development as well as industrial applications of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in Taiwan, thus enhancing the nation's international competitiveness and strategic position.

To safeguard Taiwan's digital sovereignty, the government will continue to strengthen the nation's digital infrastructure by supporting the development and research of high-performance computing systems, data centers and cloud service platforms, the premier said.

He further stated that these efforts will be integrated with six major regional flagship projects that promote balanced development across Taiwan, aiming to boost local job opportunities and economic prosperity, as well as direct resources toward small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and emerging industries. Taiwan's overall computing power will be progressively enhanced to develop an infrastructure better suited for large language model (LLM) services and applications. This will accelerate AI industrialization and its transformation of industries, as well as foster sustainable, inclusive growth in the digital economy, ensuring that AI innovations will benefit all industries and remain accessible to the wider public.
