According to the report, the Indo-Taiwan Research Center on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning is a first-of-its-kind attempt between the two countries. IIT-Ropar campus will house the research center.

A high-level delegation from the Taiwanese university visited the campus to work on the modalities of the center. The visiting delegation of NCCU included dean of research and development, dean of international affairs, dean of college of management. The director of Smart Living Technology Research Center (SLTRC) was also present.

It also included faculty members from the earth and environmental sciences, opto-mechatronics and mechanical engineering. The Taiwan Incubation Center and SLTRC’s representatives were also present.

As per the report, the aim of the center is to promote student and faculty exchanges, joint project proposals, and development of curriculum for AI-related programmes. The research centre will also focus on facilitating the industry-academia interactions.

The focus of Prime Minister Modi-led government on cutting edge technologies is evident in several schemes launched to promote the former in India. Another premier engineering institute of country, IIT-Hyderabad, has announced a full-fledged Bachelor of Technology course in Artificial Intelligence, beginning from the 2019-20 academic year.
