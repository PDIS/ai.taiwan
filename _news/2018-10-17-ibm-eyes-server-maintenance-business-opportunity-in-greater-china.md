IBM Taiwan has announced partnerships with Taiwan-based technology service providers Lealea Technology, HPi, Tung-I Information Services (TIIS), Ecom Software and Bestcom Infotech to establish a maintenance alliance for providing cross-brand and cross-system artificial intelligence (AI) technology services via its Watson platform.

In addition to Taiwan, IBM is planning to cooperate with more players to launch AI technology service platforms in other Greater China markets, according to Brian Tse, general manager of IBM Greater China's Global Technology Services.

Via IBM's platform, clients are able to acquire maintenance services for their systems without needing to concern about the systems' architectures or suppliers. IBM expects the platform to attract business opportunities from x86-based server and storage users.
