Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association (TSIA) in Hsinchu held the 2018 Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Convention, which was hosted by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) CEO and Vice Chairman C.C. Wei. During his speech, C.C. Wei pointed out that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a variety of digital applications will drive the continual prosperous development of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. In addition, Vice President Chen Chien-jen and Ministry of Science and Technology Minister Liang-Gee Chen were also in attendance as VIP speakers at the opening ceremony.

This year is the 60th anniversary of the invention of IC, and Google Taiwan General Manager Chien Lee-Feng was invited to deliver a guest keynote speech on the topic of “Future AI Trends.” Chien Lee-Feng stated that there are tremendous opportunities for AI in the cloud end, device end, and IC domains, and although Taiwan is known as the Silicon Island, it plays an even more important role in the world of AI .

The AI forum was presided over by MediaTek Chairman Ming-Kai Tsai, and MOST Minister Liang-Gee Chen, Academia Sinica Academician Hsiang-Tsung Kung, Microsoft Research Asia Senior Director of Technology Strategy and Communication Eric Chang, and Google Taiwan General Manager Chien Lee-Feng were also invited as guest speakers.

Ming-Kai Tsai noted that AI will have a tremendous impact on humanity’s jobs and lifestyles, and in the future humans and AI will coexist and enter a new era of working together to accomplish tasks. As defined by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), early on the first wave of AI was known as Handicrafted Knowledge, the second wave was Statistical Learning for deep learning neural networks, and the third wave of AI is Contextual Adaptation with the ability to understand and reason and a deepening cooperative relationship between humans and machines.

Ming-Kai Tsai also pointed out that the development of semiconductor technology is an important propeller in the AI era and the key to implementing smart technology for use in every field.
