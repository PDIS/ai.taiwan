To deal with the demand for the digital transformation of industries, Thailand 4.0 has been actively promoted by the government of Thailand, making Thailand some entrepreneurs` first choice for the development in response to the New Southbound Policy of Taiwan`s government. The AI New Generation Talent Training Program (AIGO) of the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) recently started cooperation with Advantech Co Ltd  to set up an online learning platform named the Thailand-Taiwan AI College (TTAIC). The representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Thailand, Chen-yuan Tung , chairman and CEO of the Digital Economy Promotion Agency of Thailand Dr. Nuttapon Nimmanphatchairin, and the Asia-Pacific and intercontinental regions director Vincent Chang of Advantech were invited to participate in the opening event at the Grand Mercure Bangkok Fortune on March 16. The TTAIC's courses were integrated into such diverse industries as medical, agriculture, retail, manufacturing, finance, entertainment, and education. Their students were able to quickly understand artificial intelligence (AI) applications through different case studies. Moreover, the TTAIC also helped Taiwan`s AI solutions access international markets.

Compared with ASEAN countries, Taiwan has the advantages of talent and a complete industrial chain in the development of AI. The Thailand 4.0 and Taiwan`s 5+2 Major Innovative Industries policy can complement each other in terms of the cooperation between two countries, and it will create win-win opportunities. The TTAIC aims to enhance the competitiveness and networks of the senior executives of Taiwanese enterprises and startups in Thailand, so they can obtain more resources.

Amid the global Coronavirus outbreak, TTAIC has planned a 30-hour AI course that will be available through live stream and downloads. The courses will analyze AI trends with case studies, and provide online exercises and interactive questions to make cross-border online learning more interesting.

The new southbound tasks of AIGO in 2020 include providing professional courses, producing international AI learning materials, assisting students with foundational knowledge, finding AI solutions for enterprises, and boosting digital transformation. In the future, the establishment of TTAIC and the innovative teaching model will also be promoted to other countries.
