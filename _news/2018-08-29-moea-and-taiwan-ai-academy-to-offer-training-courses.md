Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has announced it will work with Taiwan AI Academy to offer artificial intelligence technology short-term training for various industries, with the first course to begin on September 29.

Taiwan AI Academy was established by the private sector to train employees from different industries on how to use AI technologies to solve problems during upgrading toward smart manufacturing or operations. Kung Hsiang-tsung, a member of Academia Sinica and a professor with Harvard University in the US, is the president for the academy.

MOEA plans to recruit about 210 trainees from state-run and private enterprises for the upcoming course, which runs for 16 weeks in a row.

With the class as a start, MOEA, in line with the government's industrial development strategies and local industrial development needs, plans to offer industry-specific AI technology training courses, economics minister Shen Jong-chin indicated.

MOEA said it plans to recruit 200 trainees for each industry-specific course.
